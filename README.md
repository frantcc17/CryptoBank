**Secure Ether Deposits ‚Ä¢ Transparent Withdrawals ‚Ä¢ Configurable Fees**  
Ethereum smart contracts for decentralized fund management and basic banking operations.

---

## üìù Overview
CryptoBank is a blockchain-based solution designed for decentralized financial management. It allows multiple users to deposit Ether (up to a configurable maximum balance) and withdraw funds, while applying a configurable fee (expressed as a percentage on withdrawals) that is transferred directly to the admin. 

It is ideal for:
- **Decentralized Savings Platforms**
- **Community Fund Management**
- **Basic DeFi Banking Services**

Key guarantees include:
- User funds are securely stored on-chain with strict withdrawal rules.
- Withdrawals charge a fee percentage, ensuring automatic revenue splitting.
- All operations are transparently recorded via events.

## üìú Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

| Contract          | Key Functions                                   | Description                                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **`CryptoBank.sol`** | `depositEther()`<br>`withdrawEther(uint256 amount_)`<br>`setFees(uint256 newFee)`<br>`modifyMaxBalance(uint256 newMaxBalance)` | Manages user deposits and withdrawals with fee application. |

### Function Overview

- **`depositEther()`**:  
  Users deposit Ether, as long as their total balance does not exceed `maxBalance`.

- **`withdrawEther(uint256 amount_)`**:  
  Users withdraw a specified amount (entered in Ether units, converted to wei internally). A fee is calculated as a percentage of the withdrawal amount and transferred to the admin. The user's balance is updated accordingly.

- **`setFees(uint256 newFee)`**:  
  Allows the admin to set a new fee percentage (0‚Äì100).

- **`modifyMaxBalance(uint256 newMaxBalance)`**:  
  Enables the admin to update the maximum balance allowed per user.
